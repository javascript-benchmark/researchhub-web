<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>ResearchHub's ELN can help you and your labmates (1) draft notes and (2) gain visibility into all of the projects happening in your lab. This text editor is designed to help you collaboratively edit research lab notes with your teammates. Think of it like Google docs for science. Here's an overview of the most useful features:</p>

        "plain_text": "What is already known on this topic:\nDepression is a common condition, and antidepressants—particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors—are increasingly used in its treatment\nRates of cardiovascular disease are higher in people with depression, but whether different antidepressant treatments increase or reduce these rates is unclear\nHigh doses of certain antidepressants, including citalopram, can cause QT prolongation, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia, but this is not established\nWhat this study adds:\nThis study found no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a class are associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia and stroke or transient ischaemic attack in people with depression aged 20 to 64\nNo evidence was found that citalopram is associated with a significantly increased risk of arrhythmia, even at high doses\nSome indication was seen of a reduced risk of myocardial infarction for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluoxetine",
